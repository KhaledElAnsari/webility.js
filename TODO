  - Create webility.polyfills:
    - simply connect some webility.js functions to the native JS Objects
      ex: `String.prototype.capitalize = function() {/*...*/};`
      this will give the users a better experience
  - Update webility.js functions:
    - add/has/remove class functions, take a reference from `Apollo.js` or `Qwery` by ded
    - simplify some of the function (like Capitalize), decrease the lines numbers
    - prepare a better development environment using `npm` commands
